# Building fMRI Encoding Models for Natural Speech

## Background and Objectives
This project develops an encoding model to analyze fMRI data from LeBel et al. (2023), involving eight subjects listening to narrative stories. The primary task is to process and analyze a selected subset of this data from three subjects, aiming to implement an effective encoding analysis. This goal is to understand the relationship between auditory stimuli and brain activity.

It is implemented as part of [CMU 10-733 Course on Representation and Generation in Neuroscience and AI](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lwehbe/10733_S24/).
